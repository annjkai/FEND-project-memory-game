# Memory Game Project

## Game Description

The player must flip 16 randomly placed cards, 2 at a time, to find pairs of cards. The player wins the game once all cards have been matched. The game tracks the player's time and number of moves, and gives the player a number of stars between 1 and 3, based on performance (number of moves, where flipping 2 cards counts as 1 move).

This game was built with [Udacity's](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) starter code. I used vanilla JavaScript and further implemented Bootstrap. The functionality was designed to adhere to the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view).
